Project working with Marvel API

1 Realized component with an equal request to the API to receive a hero, there is also a TRY IT button for switching the hero yourself - a request is made to the server and returns a random hero from the server with its description using the function!
2 This is how you can search for a hero using the FULL name of the hero by pressing the FIND button!
3 This is how a request to the server was implemented to treat all heroes on the main page with a limit of 10
4 Made a paganization - working with the query line - by pressing the LOAD MORE button, a request is made with certain parameters and an array with 10 characters is returned!
5 There is a separate page with heroes implemented using React Router and a comics page, and a page for one hero and one comic (To receive one hero or one comic, a request is made to the server with an individual ID - https://marvel-gunplay.vercel.app /characters/1011258)
